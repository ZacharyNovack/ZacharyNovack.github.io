## Online Extremism and Hate Speech

There is currently a growing body of research within the applied machine learning community that seeks to quantify and track extremist behavior and hate speech online. I have been particularly interested in thinking about the evolution of **extremist communities and forums** (e.g. The Red Pill on Reddit, /pol/ on 4chan, etc.), as these less mainstream websites are often the progenitors of hateful rhetoric and are trafficked by possible domestic terrorists.

Recently, I have been investigating how the ideological network of a given website (pictured above is The Red Pill, for instance) is structured and how such structure evolves across time scales. This generally involves generating a topic model of the underlying text corpus, and building the linkage network given these probabilities for different timescales.

At a high level, this per-website analysis affords us the ability to measure the implications of certain administrative choices (e.g. making posts anonymous or self-delete after a fixed amount of time) on the formation and interconnectedness of different fringe viewpoints.
