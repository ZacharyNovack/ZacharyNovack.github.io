Hello! My name is Zachary Novack, and I am currently a 2nd Year Computer Science PhD Student at UC San Diego, where I am advised by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/" target="_blank">Prof. Julian McAuley</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/" target="_blank">Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick</a>. Previously, I studied statistics and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, and was primarily advised by <a href="https://www.zacharylipton.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Zachary Lipton</a> and <a href="https://sites.santafe.edu/~simon/" target="_blank">Prof. Simon DeDeo</a>. 

My research interests primarily lie in **Generative AI for Music Creation and Learning**. I am interested in making generative music systems both **controllable** and **interactive**, particularly in investigating <a href="https://ditto-music.github.io/web/" target="_blank">*training-free* control for generative music models</a>. Additionally, a high level goal of mine is to leverage AI systems to help *real musicians* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10772" target="_blank">**understand**</a>, **learn**, and **perform** music more effectively.
<!-- Specifically, I have been recently interested in controllable systems for music learning, predicting student classroom performance, and widely making deep learning an empirically-motivated research practice.  -->

In the past, I've worked on general multi-modal reasoning tasks [(ICML 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02551) and empirical deep optimization theory [(ICLR 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15853).

<!-- In the past, I have also worked extensively in computational social science, chiefly within the realms of linguistic bias and social media usage. -->

In my free time, I enjoy making [experimental computer music](https://zacharynovack.github.io/music/), writing about [scientific issues in society](https://zacharynovack.github.io/blog/), and cooking!
