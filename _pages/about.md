Hello! My name is Zachary Novack, and I am currently a 1st Year Computer SciencePhD Student at UC San Diego, where I am advised by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/" target="_blank">Prof. Julian McAuley</a>. Previously, I studied statistics and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, and was primarily advised by <a href="https://www.zacharylipton.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Zachary Lipton</a> and <a href="https://sites.santafe.edu/~simon/" target="_blank">Prof. Simon DeDeo</a>. My research interests align along three principle axes: core deep learning, AI Education, and music information retrieval. Specifically, I have been recently interested in controllable systems for music acquisition, predicting student classroom performance, and widely making deep learning an empirically-motivated research practice. In the past, I have also worked extensively in computational social science, chiefly within the realms of linguistic bias and social media usage.

In my free time, I enjoy making [experimental computer music](https://zacharynovack.github.io/music/), writing about [scientific issues in society](https://zacharynovack.github.io/blog/), and cooking!
