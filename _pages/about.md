Hello! My name is Zachary Novack, and I am currently a senior at Carnegie Mellon University, where I study statistics and machine learning, and am primarily advised by [Prof. Simon DeDeo](https://sites.santafe.edu/~simon/) and [Prof. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/). I am broadly interested in questions regarding **machine learning for social good and computational social science**, especially with regards to public policy questions in online domains, like extremism and hate speech. 
There has historically been a gap between the cutting edge of machine learning research and what is used in practice by policy makers and social scientists, despite recent leeps within fields like deep learning. I am interested in building machine learning systems to directly answer current questions in public policy, and developing new methodologies in order to expand the growing field of socially-conscious ML.

In my free time, I enjoy making [experimental computer music](https://zacharynovack.github.io/music/), writing about [scientific issues in society](https://zacharynovack.github.io/blog/), and cooking!
