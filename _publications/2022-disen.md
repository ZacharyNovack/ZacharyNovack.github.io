permalink: /publication/disentangling
authors: Zachary Novack, Simran Kaur, Tanya Marwah, Saurabh Garg, Zachary Lipton
excerpt: 'This work presents a comparative empirical study of different gradient norm-based regularizers for improving Large-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent, and ties this behavior to the trajectory of the micro-batch gradient norm during training.'
