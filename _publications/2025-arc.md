excerpt: 'This work presents Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first distillation-free adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow, enabling the development of Stable Audio Open Small, a lightweight Text-to-Audio model capable of generation 12 seconds of stereo 44.1kHz audio in 75 milliseconds.'
