collection: publications
permalink: /publication/marigold
authors: Chinmay Talegaonkar, Nikhil Gandudi Suresh, Zachary Novack, Yash Belhe, Priyanka Nagasamudra, Nicholas Antipa
excerpt: 'This work injects defocus blur cues at inference time into Marigold, a pre-trained diffusion model for zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular depth estimation (MDE), which effectively turns Marigold into a metric depth predictor in a training-free manner.'
