Welcome to the Fine-Grained Musical Difficulty User Study! The goal of this study is to collect data on the fine-grained difficulty of musical pieces, in hopes of developing a novel understanding of what makes music difficult, and whether we can automatically change the difficulty of existing musical pieces. Please note, that due to the framework of the study, we ask that you block out at least 30 minutes of time and complete the study **in a single sitting**.

First we, will describe how every part of the study works:

1) Navigating the Google Forms

Each page of the google form corresponds to a given piece, and looks like the following:

<img src="/form.png"
     alt="form"
     style="float: center;"
     height=850px
     width=650px/>

Here, the `Link to Score` link will open up the given piece in the score following software in your current browser.

2) Using the Score Follower Software

Without any score loaded, the score follower software will look like the following (note that a score will always be loaded when you click on the corresponding link):

<img src="/UI.png"
     alt="ui"
     style="float: center;"
     height=700px
     width=800px/>

For a given piece, the score is auto-formatted to fit the entire piece into one page, but you may need to scroll down in order to initially get the entire score into view.Note that clicking **anywhere** in the piece will advance the cursor to that position, so make sure that before recording, the cursor is at the start of the piece!

Once a given score is loaded in, you can click **Start** in the upper left-hand corner of the screen in order to start the recording. Note that by default, the program will **not** generate its own audio output for every note played; if you want to enable the audio in lieu of using your own audio output, navigate to the `File` dropdown menu in the top right-hand corner and change the `Synthesizer` option from `No sound` to `Internal Synth`.

For every piece, the tempo will be constant which a vertical bar indicating where in the score you are. Additionally, every piece starts with a count in (4/4 and 2/4 will each get 4 beats of count in, 3/4 gets 3, and 6/8 gets 6 in eighth notes). Please sightread through the **entirety** of the piece and let it stop automatically. The online score-follower will automatically detect any MIDI device that is plugged into your computer. If you do not own a MIDI device, please do not complete this study.

Note: Each piece's tempo is intended to be at a reasonable tempo to sightread. That being said, feel free to change the tempo if needed by editing the number in the top left-hand corner (though do try to refrain from this)!

Once the piece finishes, an output .txt file will be downloaded in your downloads folder named as `[name of piece]_outputs.txt`. For each readthrough you do of the piece, please upload the output file to the corresponding file upload question in the google form.

3) Recap

Given the above guide on how the study works, for each piece you will be tasked with:
- Sightreading the piece in its entirety 1-3 times
- Upload each output file into the corresponding box on the google form
- Answer the questions on the google form regarding the given piece

We ask that you do not take too much time between takes to practice (on average, you should take about a minute at most if completing the study in one sitting), and that you do **not** practice the piece at all before the first sightreading attempt.

Happy Sightreading!
