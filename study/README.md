Welcome to the Fine-Grained Musical Difficulty User Study! First we, will describe how every part of the study works:

1) Opening the score follower

In the `study` directory, navigate to the `follow_371` directory and open `follow.html`. This will open the web-based score-follower directly in your default browser. (Note: Chrome is preferred)

2) Loading in each piece

In the online score follower, navigate to the upper right-hand corner menu *File* and click on it. This will produce a drop-down menu, where you will next click on the button that says *Choose File* (which should be the first button). This will open your file navigation. From here, navigate into the `study/playlist` directory and choose one of the scores, which should each be a `.js` file. This will load the score into the online score follower. The score is auto-formatted to fit the entire piece into one page, but you may need to scroll down in order to initially get the entire score into view. Note that clicking **anywhere** in the piece will advance the cursor to that position, so make sure that before recording, the cursor is at the start of the piece!

3) Recording the piece

Once a given score is loaded in, you can click *start* in the upper left-hand corner of the screen in order to start the recording. Note that by default, the program will generate its own audio output for every note played; if you want to disable the audio in favor of using your own audio output (if available), navigate to the `File` dropdown menu in the top right-hand corner and change the `Synthesizer` option from `Internal synth` to `No sound`. For every piece, the tempo will be constant which a vertical bar indicating where in the score you are. Additionally, every piece starts with a count in (4/4 and 2/4 will each get 4 beats of count in, 3/4 gets 3, and 6/8 gets 6 in eighth notes). Please sightread through the **entirety** of the piece and let it stop automatically. The online score-follower will automatically detect any MIDI device that is plugged into your computer. If you do not own a MIDI device, please do not complete this study.

Note: Each piece's tempo is intended to be at a reasonable tempo to sightread. That being said, feel free to change the tempo if needed by editing the number in the top left-hand corner (though do try to refrain from this)!

Once the piece finishes, an output .txt file will be downloaded in your downloads folder named as `[name of piece]_outputs.txt`. Currently, the program does not support automatically putting this into the `study/outputs` directory, so please manually move the output file into `study/outputs`.

4) Filling out the google form (https://forms.gle/DMMJfEKKdxSj23YN6)

On top of the sightreading portion, we have also included a brief user survey to understand perceptual difficulty levels of each piece. For each piece, there is a corresponding section of the form (https://forms.gle/DMMJfEKKdxSj23YN6) where you will answer a few questions about the piece.

Given the above set-up instructions, please complete the pieces in the following order:
1) revali.js
2) kass.js
3) merry107.js
4) tale107.js
5) polonaise.js
6) ori.js
7) ddd.js
8) mazurka.js
9) harmonics.js
10) sidon.js
11) apple.js
12) journey.js

For each piece in the playlist directory
1) load the piece into the score follower
2) **sightread** the piece in its entirety 1-3 times
3) move the corresponding output file(s) into the outputs folder
4) Answer the questions in the corresponding section of the form: https://forms.gle/DMMJfEKKdxSj23YN6

Note that you may record a piece multiple times, but make sure to edit the names of the output files to reflect the order of each recording for a given piece.
